<h2>Extra Credit for Final Exam</h2>
<p>One of the biggest favors you can do for me, is to complete a course evaluation. </p>
<p>Here's how you can help me do that: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to <a href="https://my.lonestar.edu" target="_blank">myLoneStar</a>.</li>
	<li>Click the Enrollment button to the left.</li>
	<li>Click the Course Evaluations link on the drop down menu.</li>
	<li>Click on our course name and begin answering questions.</li>
	<li>When completing your evaluation, please consider all aspects of our class:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>the course content</li>
		<li>usefulness of Excel 2016</li>
		<li>your online experience, i.e., D2L and Slack</li>
		<li>your experience using SIMnet and Connect</li>
		<li>my teaching style (good and bad)</li>
		<li>my communication outside of class (Slack / email / D2L messages)</li>
		<li>anything else that you feel is pertinent</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<p>Please know that the Course Evaluation system keeps your comments and ratings "anonymous" - for this reason you should feel completely comfortable giving me any and all feedback.</p>
<p>As an incentive, I will add 15 points to your overall point total if you will complete this by the posted Due Date.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT:  You must take a screenshot of your Course Evaluation page after you have submitted it so that I can see that you have completed the task.  Please submit this screenshot by uploading that into the Resources assignment in SIMnet.</p>
