<h2>Week 6 - Exploring the Function Library (Ch6) | Working with Templates and Co-Authoring (Ch7)</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The Excel Function Library includes functions that perform complex and sophisticated calculations for use in business, government, education, and research. In this chapter, you learn about functions in the Database, Logical, Date & Time, Financial, and Text categories. You also nest functions and build time, date, and statistical calculations.</p>  
<p>Excel templates are model workbooks. When you create a new workbook, you use a default template with basic settings, including a document theme, a font name and size, and default margins. When you co-author a workbook, you and colleagues collaborate on a shared file.</p>
