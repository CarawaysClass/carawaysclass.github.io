<h2>Week 7 - Exploring Data Analysis and Business Intelligence (Ch8) | Recording and Editing Macros (Ch9)</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Excel provides self-service business intelligence (BI) with its data analysis tools so that you can use Excel to accomplish what previously required the help of an information technology department. In this chapter, you explore scenarios, Goal Seek, Solver, data tables, and more.
Routine tasks such as entering the same label or calculating results for the same range can often be handled by macros. A macro is a series of instructions and keystrokes that executes a command. In this chapter, you learn how to run and record a macro, how to edit a macro in the Visual Basic Editor, and how to create a macro-enabled template.</p>
