<h2>Week 7 - Working with Macros (Ch8) | Exploring Data Analysis and Maps (Ch9)</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Routine tasks such as entering the same label or moving and copying a worksheet can often be handled by macros. A macro is a series of instructions and keystrokes that executes a command. In this chapter, you learn how to run and record a macro, how to edit and write a macro in the Visual Basic Editor, and how to create a macro-enabled workbook.</p>
<p>
Excel provides self-service business intelligence (BI) with its data analysis tools so that you can use Excel to accomplish what previously required the help of an information technology department. In this chapter, you explore scenarios, Goal Seek, Solver, data tables, maps, and more.</p>
