<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Managing Systems Projects and Requirements Modeling</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Project management is a key component of any successful system development project.  This week we look at how to plan, schedule, monitor, and report on IT projects.
<p>
Next, we look at the requirements modeling process which includes:
<ul>
<li>gathering facts about a systems project</li>
<li>preparing documentation</li>
<li>creating models that will be used to design and develop the system</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>At the end of this week, you will be able to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Explain project planning, scheduling, monitoring, and reporting</li>
<li>Draw a project triangle that shows the relationship among project cost, scope, and time</li>
<li>Create a work breakdown structure, identify task patterns, and calculate a critical path</li>
<li>Explain techniques for estimating task completion times and costs</li>
<li>Describe various scheduling tools, including Gantt charts and PERT/CPM charts</li>
<li>Analyze task dependencies, durations, start dates, and end dates</li>
<li>Describe project management software and how it can be of assistance</li>
<li>Control and manage project changes as they occur</li>
<li>Discuss the importance of managing project risks</li>
<li>Understand why projects sometimes fail</li>
