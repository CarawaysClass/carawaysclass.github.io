<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Managing Systems Projects and Requirements Modeling</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Project management is a key component of any successful system development project.  This week we look at how to plan, schedule, monitor, and report on IT projects.
<p>
Next, we look at the requirements modeling process which includes:
<ul>
<li>gathering facts about a systems project</li>
<li>preparing documentation</li>
<li>creating models that will be used to design and develop the system</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
