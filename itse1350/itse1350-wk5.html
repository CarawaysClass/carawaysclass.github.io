<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
With requirements defined, a system analyst focuses on how system data is transformed into useful information.  The deliverable of data and process modeling is a logical model. A logical model shows what the system must do, regardless of how it will be implemented physically. Later, in the systems design phase, a physical model is built that describes how the system will be constructed. Data and process modeling involves three main tools: 
<ul>
<li>data flow diagrams</li>
<li>a data dictionary</li>
<li>process descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>At the end of this week, you will be able to: 
<ul>
<li>Describe data and process modeling concepts and tools, including data flow diagrams, a data dictionary, and process descriptions</li>
</ul>Describe the symbols used in data flow diagrams and explain the rules for their use</li>
</ul>Draw data flow diagrams in a sequence, from general to specific</li>
</ul>Explain how to level and balance a set of data flow diagrams</li>
</ul>Describe how a data dictionary is used and what it contains</li>
</ul>Use process description tools, including structured English, decision tables, and decision trees</li>
</ul>Describe the relationship between logical and physical models</li>
</ul>
