<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">User Interface Design and Data Design</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
User interface design is the first task in the systems design phase of the SDLC. Designing the interface is extremely important because everyone wants a system that is easy to learn and use.</p>
<p>After discussing the user interface, human-computer interaction, and interface design rules, the analyst must look at the output, data security and control issues, prototyping, and the next steps in the systems design process.
</p>
<p>
During the systems analysis phase, a logical model of the system was created. Next, the analyst must look at how data will be organized, stored, and managed. These are important issues that affect data quality and consistency.</p>
<p>Understanding data design concepts is essential for the analyst to design the databases used to store, edit, retrieve data of the designed system.
</p>
