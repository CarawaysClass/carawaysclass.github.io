<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
During the systems analysis phase, a logical model of the system was created. Next, the analyst must look at how data will be organized, stored, and managed. These are important issues that affect data quality and consistency.</p>
<p>Understanding data design concepts is essential for the analyst to design the databases used to store, edit, retrieve data of the designed system.
