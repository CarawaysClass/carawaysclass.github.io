<h2>Semester Project #1 - System Requirements Document</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Now that we’re deep into the section of our textbook that covers Systems Analysis (chapter 4-6), it’s time to put into practice some of what you have learned so far. Starting with a set of JAD session notes, we will look at developing a list of requirements, refining those into a Functional Decomposition Diagram(s), developing the related Data Flow Diagram(s), Decision Table(s), Decision Tree(s), and Use Cases as part of documenting system requirements.</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Revisit the SCR Case Simulation for units 1 - 6 in MindTap.</li>
	<li>Review the related unit readings.</li>
	<li>Research and identify various software tools (CASE, diagramming, modeling, etc.) that can be used to create the different pieces of our requirements document.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assignment Tasks</h3>

<ol>
	<li>From your research of modeling software tools, post your findings about two or more of those tools in our #requirements_modeling channel of Slack.</li>
	<li>In the SCR Case Simulation Session 4:
		<ol style = "list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>Read the JAD session summary in the Data Library and put together a list of system requirements, including outputs, inputs, processes, performance, and controls.</li>
			<li>Draw an FDD of the main functions for TIMS. Be sure to show at least one or two levels of detail.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>In the SCR Case Simulation Session 5:
		<ol style = "list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>Review the JAD session summary and create a lower-level DFD for each process</li>
			<li>Prepare a Decision Table and a Decision Tree that show the logical rules about fees and discounts (per the messages from Jesse). Explain how you created the decision table and decision tree.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>In the SCR Case Simulation Session 6, review the details about object modeling and the JAD session summary (per Jesse’s email) then create a Use case model that shows how students register. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>

<p>This assignment is worth a total of 100 points. The Grading Rubric breaks out as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Software tools review post In Slack #requirements_modeling channel (20 pts)</li>
	<li>a. System Requirements List (10 pts)

		<p>b. Functional Decomposition Diagram (10 pts)</p></li>
	<li>a. Lower Level Data Flow Diagrams for each process (20 pts)

		<p>b. Decision Table and Decision Tree (20 pts)</p></li>
	<li>Use Case Model of the student registration process (20 pts)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Work</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Post your software tools review In Slack #requirements_modeling channel</li>
	<li>Create a single PDF document that includes all of the other components (lists, diagrams, descriptions, models, etc.) and upload that in the D2L Dropbox by the Due Date.</li>
</ol>
