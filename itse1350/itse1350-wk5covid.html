<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">System Architecture and Managing Systems Implementation</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
During  implementation, the system design specification serves as a blueprint for developing the new system. The initial task is application development, which requires systems analysts and programmers to work together to construct the necessary programs and code modules. Before a changeover, the system must be tested and documented carefully, users must be trained, and existing data must be converted. After the new system is operational, a formal evaluation of the results takes place as part of a final report to management.
</p>
<p>
The systems support and security phase begins when a system becomes operational and continues until the system reaches the end of its useful life.  Acting as an internal consultant, the analyst provides guidance, support, and training. Successful systems often need the most support because users want to learn the features, try all the capabilities, and discover how the system can help them perform their tasks. In most organizations, more than half of all IT department effort goes into supporting existing systems.
