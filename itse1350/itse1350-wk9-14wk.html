<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">User Interface Design</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
User interface design is the first task in the systems design phase of the SDLC. Designing the interface is extremely important because everyone wants a system that is easy to learn and use.</p>
<p>After discussing the user interface, human-computer interaction, and interface design rules, the analyst must look at the output, data security and control issues, prototyping, and the next steps in the systems design process.
</p>
