<h2>Semester Project #2 - Interface and Database Design Document</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Building on what you developed in our first semester project (the Systems Requirements document) you will develop the initial User Interface design and the initial Database design.</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Review your System Requirements Document submission.</li>
	<li>Revisit the SCR Case Simulation for units 7 - 9 in MindTap.</li>
	<li>Review the related unit readings.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assignment Tasks</h3>

<ol>
	<li>From the SCR Case Simulation Session 8:
		<ol style = "list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>Create a detail report that will display all SCR courses in alphabetical order, with the course name and the instructor name in a group header; the Social Security number, name, and telephone number of each current student in the detail section; and the student count in a group footer.</li>
			<li>Create a switchboard design with control buttons that lead to students, instructors, courses, course schedules, and course rosters. Allow a user to add, update, or delete records in each area. Consider laying these out as a storyboard of your proposed screens.</li>
			<li>Within your design, list the appropriate data validation checks for the data entry screens.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>From the SCR Case Simulation Session 9:
		<ol style = "list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>List all the entities that interact with the TIMS system by reviewing your requirements document including the data library, DFDs, etc.</li>
			<li>Draw an ERD that shows cardinality relationships among the entities.</li>
			<li>For each entity, make sure your table design is in 3NF. Use standard notation format to show the primary key and the other fields in each table.</li>
			<li>For each table, provide sample data for all fields for at least three records.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>

<p>This assignment is worth a total of 200 points. The Grading Rubric breaks out as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Detail report (50 pts)</li>
	<li>Switchboard Design (70 pts)</li>
	<li>Entity List (20 pts)</li>
	<li>Entity Relationship Diagram (60 pts)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Work</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Create a single PDF document that includes all of the other components (Detail Report, Switchboard Design, Entity List, and ERD) and upload that in the D2L Dropbox by the Due Date.</li>
</ol>
