<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Data and Process Modeling, Object Modeling, and Development Strategies</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
With requirements defined, a system analyst focuses on how system data is transformed into useful information.  The deliverable of data and process modeling is a logical model. A logical model shows what the system must do, regardless of how it will be implemented physically. Later, in the systems design phase, a physical model is built that describes how the system will be constructed. Data and process modeling involves three main tools: 
<ul>
<li>data flow diagrams</li>
<li>a data dictionary</li>
<li>process descriptions</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In contrast, object-oriented (O-O) analysis describes an information system by identifying things called objects. An object represents a real person, a place, an event, or a transaction. For example, when a patient makes an appointment to see a doctor, the patient is an object, the doctor is an object, and the appointment itself is an object.
</p>
<p>Object-oriented analysis is a popular approach that sees a system from the viewpoint of the objects themselves as they function and interact. The end product of O-O analysis is an object model, which represents the information system in terms of objects and O-O concepts. Object-oriented analysis provides us with another way to view and model system requirements. 
</p>
<p>
After completing the requirements modeling, data and process modeling, and object modeling, it's time to evaluate the alternative solutions, prepare  the system requirements document, and present the system requirements document to management.
