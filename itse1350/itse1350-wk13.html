<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Managing Systems Support and Security</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The systems support and security phase begins when a system becomes operational and continues until the system reaches the end of its useful life.  Acting as an internal consultant, the analyst provides guidance, support, and training. Successful systems often need the most support because users want to learn the features, try all the capabilities, and discover how the system can help them perform their tasks. In most organizations, more than half of all IT department effort goes into supporting existing systems.
