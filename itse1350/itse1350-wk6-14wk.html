<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Object Modeling</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Object-oriented (O-O) analysis describes an information system by identifying things called objects. An object represents a real person, a place, an event, or a transaction. For example, when a patient makes an appointment to see a doctor, the patient is an object, the doctor is an object, and the appointment itself is an object.
</p>
<p>Object-oriented analysis is a popular approach that sees a system from the viewpoint of the objects themselves as they function and interact. The end product of O-O analysis is an object model, which represents the information system in terms of objects and O-O concepts. Object-oriented analysis provides us with another way to view and model system requirements.
