<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Managing Systems Implementation</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
During  implementation, the system design specification serves as a blueprint for developing the new system. The initial task is application development, which requires systems analysts and programmers to work together to construct the necessary programs and code modules. Before a changeover, the system must be tested and documented carefully, users must be trained, and existing data must be converted. After the new system is operational, a formal evaluation of the results takes place as part of a final report to management.
