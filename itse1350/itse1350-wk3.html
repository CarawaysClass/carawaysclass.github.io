<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Data and Process Modeling and Object Modeling</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
With requirements defined, a system analyst focuses on how system data is transformed into useful information.  The deliverable of data and process modeling is a logical model. A logical model shows what the system must do, regardless of how it will be implemented physically. Later, in the systems design phase, a physical model is built that describes how the system will be constructed. Data and process modeling involves three main tools: 
<ul>
<li>data flow diagrams</li>
<li>a data dictionary</li>
<li>process descriptions</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In contrast, object-oriented (O-O) analysis describes an information system by identifying things called objects. An object represents a real person, a place, an event, or a transaction. For example, when a patient makes an appointment to see a doctor, the patient is an object, the doctor is an object, and the appointment itself is an object.
</p>
<p>Object-oriented analysis is a popular approach that sees a system from the viewpoint of the objects themselves as they function and interact. The end product of O-O analysis is an object model, which represents the information system in terms of objects and O-O concepts. Object-oriented analysis provides us with another way to view and model system requirements.
