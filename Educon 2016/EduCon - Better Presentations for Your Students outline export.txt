	* Description
	* Goals
	* From the flyer
	- Planning your Presentation
		- Know your audience
			- image idea:  classroom of students looking towards the camera, eyeball, looking through a mag lense
			- Traditional vs. non-traditional
				- Are they looking for a handout or takeaway?
					- reference the takeaway from this session
				- Paper vs. digital (downloadable from D2L)
				- They may expect a copy of slides.
			- Accommodation for disabilities
				- Closed captioning of videos shown in class
				- also applies to media outside of class (eTexts and video lessons)
		- Know your room
			- image idea:  university lecture room (downloaded)
			- lighting
				- are room lights controllable, especially the light bank(s) immediately in front of projector screen/surface? consider turning these off to make for easier viewing.  image idea:  two slides one of lights one switching to lights off or just a light switch
				- close the blinds (image idea:  blinds closing)
				- change your slide theme accordingly - high contrast between background and texts
			- size / dimensions
				- is the room wide?  students up front on wings viewing from periphery
				- is the room long/deep?  
				- check “readability” from extreme seats
			- pull-down projection screen or does it just project on wall?
			- orientation of instructor station and presentation surface
			- using your own laptop (or tablet)
				- connectors/adapters
					- hdmi
					- vga
			- audio - for display of videos or other audio enabled content
				- remember that hdmi carries audio in addition to video
			- presentation remote
				- 
		- Suggested reading:  Presentation Zen book and site (Garr Reynolds)
			- image idea:  book cover and link/image from website, photo of Garr 
		- Publisher-provided slides
			- usable?  It depends…I have yet to see a publisher-provided slide deck that is ready to be used “out of the box”.  In some instances, they do have images that you might want “lift” and bring over into your own presentation.
				- just check their resolution - this is often lacking  
			- image idea:  find example of worst publisher provide slide out there (see MyITLab slide decks)
	- Building your Presentation
		- Too Many Words
			- image idea: font typesetting (downloaded)
			- relate to earlier point about knowing your audience
				- young millennials don’t relate to this heck
				- …neither do I
				- Do you?!?
		- imagery
			- stock images
			- transparent backgrounds and alpha channel tools
			- teacher-friendly stock image sites (CC and free)
			- suggested referencing (small hyperlink to source listed at bottom of image)
				- Make sure to do the same in this presentation (practice what we preach)
		- PowerPoint alternatives
			- Prezi
			- HaikuDeck
	- Delivering your Presentation
		- laptop vs tablet
		* CloseUp
		- image idea:  Showtime sign
	- Archiving your Presentation
		- for your students and for your reference (in future to semesters) 
		- Posting to D2L - good idea or not?
		- Slide hosting
			- slideshare.com
			- slides.com
	- Q & A
		- should I provide my students with my slidedeck each class?
			- suggest that they provide a 1-page "take-away"
			- or give them an interactive work sheet
		- How can I best leverage the publisher provided PowerPoint resources?  Or should I even?
