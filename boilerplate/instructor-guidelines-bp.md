## Instructor Guidelines and Policies 

### Communication
We will use <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack.com</a> for most student-to-professor and student-to-student communication.  Slack is an on-line communication tool that allows team members or students in a class to stay in contact with each other.  

With Slack, you can hold a direct conversation with your instructor, share an idea with one of your classmates, or enter into a discussion with a group of your classmates.

I will email you an invitation to our Slack class site, during the first week of class.  This will include everything you will need to know in order to join and participate in our Slack class.


### Emailing Your Instructor
Slack is always your best choice in communicating with me, but there may be instances where you wish to email me.  If you choose to use email, be sure to include your name, course name, and course number in the email.  If you do not fully identify yourself and course info, I will likely not reply.  Keep the body of your message brief, and to-the-point.  Here is an example of a good email:

> Professor Caraway:

>I am Angela Ford from your BCIS 1305 (Business Computer Apps) class, and I have a question about this week’s assignment.  I thought that we needed to complete both sections, am I correct?  Can you please help me?

>Angela Ford


### Office Visits
I currently live several hours from Houston so I only visit campus several times during the semester.  Once our semester begins, I will let you know the days that I plan to be on campus if you wish to meet face-to-face with me.  

Please know that I am always happy to set up a "virtual" meeting using WebEx or a phone call - just contact me via Slack to schedule a session.   

### Attendance
We do not formally meet during the week so no attendance is taken.  I do reserve the right to assign tasks that may require your participation in on-line Slack discussion channels.  It is your responsibility to keep up with the material and to check in for updates, assignment due dates, and potential schedule changes.

Should you anticipate that you will not be able to log on and participate in class for an extended period (72 hours), please notify me in advance.  Not logging in to the on-line class at a regular interval will significantly impact your chance for success.   **I will withdraw a student if they are not active in the course and do not respond to my Slack or email correspondence during a 7 day period.**
 
 
### Class Participation
The college classroom is a place for adult men and women to meet with a common purpose of improving their intellectual and academic skills.  This applies to both face-to-face and on-line classes.  When engaging your instructor and fellow students, you will be expected to treat everyone with respect and in a professional manner.  The use of profanity, derogatory terms, and threats in any class-related forum will not be tolerated.  If a student violates this rule, they will be asked to leave the classroom (in a face-to-face section) or their access to the class will be blocked (in an on-line section).  

The violating student will not be allowed to return to class or regain access until he or she arranges a conference with the instructor.  It is the student’s responsibility to arrange for this conference. 
     
### Civility Statement
Members of the Lone Star College, which includes faculty, staff, and students, are expected to act honestly and responsibly in all aspects of campus life. Lone Star College holds all members accountable for their actions and words. Therefore, all members should commit themselves to behave in a manner that recognizes personal respect, and demonstrates concern for personal dignity, rights, and freedom of every member of the College community, including respect for the College property and the physical and intellectual property of others.
