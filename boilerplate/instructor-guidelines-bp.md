## Instructor Guidelines and Policies 

### Communication
We will use <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack.com</a> for most student-to-professor and student-to-student communication.  Slack is an on-line communication tool that allows team members or students in a class to stay in contact with each other.  

With Slack, you can hold a direct conversation with your instructor, share an idea with one of your classmates, or enter into a discussion with a group of your classmates.

I will email you an invitation to our Slack class site, during the first week of class.  This will include everything you will need to know in order to join and participate in our Slack class.


### Emailing Your Instructor
Slack is always your best choice in communicating with me, but there may be instances where you need to email me, e.g., you are unable to login to Slack.  In these instances, be sure to include your name, course name, and course number in the email.  If you do not fully identify yourself and the course, I will likely not reply.  Keep the body of your message brief and to-the-point.  Here is an example of a good email:

> Professor Caraway:

>I am Angela Ford from your BCIS 1305 (Business Computer Apps) class. I am having difficulty accessing our Slack class site.  Can you please help me?

>Angela Ford


### Attendance
We do not formally meet during the week so no attendance is taken.  I do reserve the right to assign tasks that may require your participation in on-line Slack discussion channels.  It is your responsibility to keep up with the material and to check in for updates, assignment due dates, and potential schedule changes.

Should you anticipate that you will not be able to log on and participate in class for an extended period (72 hours), please notify me in advance.  Not logging in to the on-line class at a regular interval will significantly impact your chance for success.   **I will withdraw a student if they are not active in the course and do not respond to my Slack or email correspondence during a 7 day period.**

### Office Visits
With campuses closed for the ongoing pandemic, I am happy to set up a "virtual" meeting using WebEx or a phone call - just contact me via Slack to schedule a session.    

### Late Work 
Work is to be submitted by the Due Date. **Late work may be declined or subject to penalty.**

### Class Participation
The college classroom is a place for adult men and women to meet with a common purpose of improving their intellectual and academic skills.  This applies to both face-to-face and on-line classes.  When engaging your instructor and fellow students, you will be expected to treat everyone with respect and in a professional manner.  The use of profanity, derogatory terms, and threats in any class-related forum will not be tolerated.  If a student violates this rule, they will be asked to leave the classroom (in a face-to-face section) or their access to the class will be blocked (in an on-line section).  

The violating student will not be allowed to return to class or regain access until he or she arranges a conference with the instructor.  It is the student’s responsibility to arrange for this conference. 
     
### Civility Statement
Members of the Lone Star College, which includes faculty, staff, and students, are expected to act honestly and responsibly in all aspects of campus life. Lone Star College holds all members accountable for their actions and words. Therefore, all members should commit themselves to behave in a manner that recognizes personal respect, and demonstrates concern for personal dignity, rights, and freedom of every member of the College community, including respect for the College property and the physical and intellectual property of others. 

### Non-attendance at Start of Semester

You must **log into our class** and **post to the #introductions Slack channel by to the Official Day of Record (ODR)**.  Otherwise, you will be administratively withdrawn from the class, no exceptions.  For Summer I 2020, ODR is:  

- May 14, 2020  

Please make every effort to login and post to the Slack #introductions channel ASAP - don't delay.

### Withdrawal Policy
Withdrawal from the course after the official day of record and prior to “W” Day, June 2, 2020 will result in a final grade of “W” on your transcript.  Instructor approval is necessary if you want to withdraw after official day.  No credit will be awarded for a course earning a “W.”  If you stop attending class, you must withdraw at the registration office prior to “W” day.  

_If you stop attending class and do not officially withdraw, you **will receive an “F”** for the course._

### Incompletes
An ‘I’ or Incomplete will be considered only in extreme cases of illness or emergency.  An Incomplete will only be considered for those students who have completed at least 75% of the course material and have a passing average (70 or better) for those assignments that they have completed.  Granting an Incomplete is fully at the discretion of your instructor.  

A student who receives an "I" does not re-register for the course and must complete the course no later than the set due date not to exceed the end of the following fall or spring semester. The instructor must submit a signed “I” contract to the appropriate division; students will receive a copy of the contract following approval by the Dean or designee.

### Six Drop Rule
Students who enrolled in Texas public institutions of higher education as first-time college students during the Fall 2007 term or later are subject to section 51.907 of the Texas Education Code, which states that an institution of higher education may not permit a student to drop (withdraw with a grade of “W”) from more than six courses, including courses that a transfer student has previously dropped at other Texas public institutions of higher education that have already been counted against their six drop limit.   Each student should fully understand this drop limit before you drop any course.  Please see a Counselor or Advisor in our Student Services area for additional information and assistance. <span style="color: red">_This policy does not affect developmental or ESOL students._</span>

### Conflict Resolution
If you have an issue with any aspect of the class (grading, policies, instructor behavior, etc.), please discuss the issue with your instructor outside of class time.  If you cannot resolve the issue with your instructor, you may contact the department chair to further discuss the matter.
