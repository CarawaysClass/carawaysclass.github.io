1. You’ll be eligible for more jobs.
1. You could have higher earning potential.
1. You can finish in two years or less.
1. You have options for career paths.
1. You can discover what you want from your academic program and career.

1. Many of the colleges in Texas have articulation agreements with community colleges that allow you to receive full credit for the courses you have completed.
1. Your transfer acceptance is higher with an associate’s degree.

If you have any questions or need guidance with your academic plan and graduation, please ask for assistance. There are resources, advisors, and additional materials available to you. Because your academic success is important, Lone Star College fosters and commits to a set of cultural beliefs.
