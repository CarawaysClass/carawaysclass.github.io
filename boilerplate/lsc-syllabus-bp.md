### Non Attendance at Start of Semester

You must **log into our class** and **post to the #introductions Slack channel by to the Official Day of Record (ODR)**.  Otherwise, you will be administratively withdrawn from the class, no exceptions.  For Spring 2020, ODR is:
- Jan 27th for regular 16 Week classes
- Jan 21st for 8 Week Session 1 classes
- Mar 23rd for 8 Week Session 2 classes   

Please make every effort to login and post to the Slack #introductions channel ASAP - don't delay.

### Withdrawal Policy
Withdrawal from the course after the Official Day of Record and prior to “W” Day will result in a final grade of “W” on your transcript.  Instructor approval is necessary if you want to withdraw after the Official Day.  No credit will be awarded for a course earning a “W.”  If you stop participating in the on-line class, you must withdraw at the registration office prior to “W” day.  For Spring 2020, W Day is:
- Apr 1st for regular 16 Week classes
- Feb 21st for 8 Week Session 1 classes
- Apr 24th for 8 Week Session 2 classes

_If you stop attending class and do not officially withdraw, you **will receive an “F”** for the course._

### Incompletes
An ‘I’ or Incomplete will be considered only in extreme cases of illness or emergency.  An Incomplete will only be considered for those students who have completed at least 75% of the course material and have a passing average (70 or better) for those assignments that they have completed.  Granting an Incomplete is fully at the discretion of your instructor.  

A student who receives an "I" does not re-register for the course and must complete the course no later than the set due date not to exceed the end of the following fall or spring semester. The instructor must submit a signed “I” contract to the appropriate division; students will receive a copy of the contract following approval by the Dean or designee.

### Early Alert
Early Alert is a student success effort designed to help students reach their full educational potential and successfully complete their classes.  By requesting Early Alert for a student, a faculty member sends a message to the advising/counseling team, who will then contact the student and schedule a meeting to discuss support options. Students may be referred to Early Alert for many reasons, including poor academic performance, lack of basic study skills, attendance, persistent tardiness, and personal or financial issues that interfere with class performance.

### Six Drop Rule
Students who enrolled in Texas public institutions of higher education as first-time college students during the Fall 2007 term or later are subject to section 51.907 of the Texas Education Code, which states that an institution of higher education may not permit a student to drop (withdraw with a grade of “W”) from more than six courses, including courses that a transfer student has previously dropped at other Texas public institutions of higher education that have already been counted against their six drop limit.   Each student should fully understand this drop limit before you drop any course.  Please see a Counselor or Advisor in our Student Services area for additional information and assistance. <span style="color: red">_This policy does not affect developmental or ESOL students._</span>

## Lone Star College-University Park Campus and System Policies

### Academic Integrity
The Lone Star College System upholds the core values of learning: honesty, respect, fairness, and accountability.  The system promotes the importance of personal and academic honesty.  The system embraces the belief that all learners – students, faculty, staff and administrators – will act with integrity and honesty and must produce their own work and give appropriate credit to the work of others.  Fabrication of sources, cheating, or unauthorized collaboration is not permitted on any work submitted within the system.

The consequences for academic dishonesty are determined by the professor, or the professor and academic dean, or the professor and chief student services officer and can include but are not limited to:  

1. Having additional class requirements imposed,  
2. Receiving a grade of zero or “F” for an exam or assignment,  
3. Receiving a grade of “F” for the course,
4. Being withdrawn from the course or program,
5. Being expelled from the college system.

### Student Behavior Expectations
Students are expected to conduct themselves appropriately while on College property or in an on-line environment.  Students may receive disciplinary action up to and including suspension, if they violate System or College rules, disrupt classes, or interfere with the opportunity of others to obtain an education.  Students who pose a threat to the safety of others will be subject to immediate withdrawal from the classroom, campus environment, and/or on-line environment, as well as face subsequent criminal charges, as appropriate.  

**Please refer to the Student Code of Conduct located on-line at <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/student-responsibilities.htm"  target="_blank">www.lonestar.edu/student-responsibilities.htm</a> for additional information.**

### Lone Star College Assistive Facilities
Lone Star College is very committed to equal access in educational opportunities and provides assistance through disability services. Each main campus has an assistive technology lab to assist students with disabilities. These centers offer a wide range of educational technology tools, such as screen readers, for example, to assist students with their educational needs.  Information specific to your campus' Assistive Services is located on-line at <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/19287.htm" target="_blank">www.lonestar.edu/19287.htm</a>.  

### Americans with Disabilities Act Statement
Lone Star College-University Park is dedicated to providing the least restrictive environment for all students.  We promote equity in academic access through the implementation of reasonable accommodations as required by the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title V, Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) which will enable students with disabilities to participate in and benefit from all post-secondary educational activities.

### Campus Carry
The Texas Legislature enacted campus carry by passing Senate Bill 11, effective at LSC on August 1, 2017.  Senate Bill 11, known as the “Campus Carry” law, amends Texas law to allow license holders to carry concealed handguns on college campuses.  To carry a concealed handgun on LSC campuses, an individual must have a valid License to Carry issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety.
 
LSC has established rules and regulations regarding enforcement of Campus Carry.  Lone Star College prohibits concealed carry in some areas of LSC campuses.  For more information about Campus Carry, visit the <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/campuscarry" target="_blank">LSC Campus Carry website</a>.

### Computer Virus Protection
Computer viruses are, unfortunately, a fact of life.  Using flash drives on more than one computer creates the possibility of infecting additional computers and flash drives with computer viruses.  This exposes college computers, personal computers, and any other computers to potentially damaging viruses.  The college has aggressive anti-virus procedures in place to protect its computers, but cannot guarantee that a virus might not temporarily infect one of its machines.  It is your responsibility to protect all computers under your control and use and ensure that each flash drive you use,  wherever you use it, has been scanned with anti-virus software.  

### Equal Opportunity Statement
It is the policy of the Lone Star College System to provide equal employment, admission and educational opportunities without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, gender, age, veteran's status, sexual orientation, or disability.  Lone Star Colleges strive to provide an excellent learning environment free from harassment or intimidation directed at any person’s race, color, creed, national origin, gender, age, veteran's status, sexual orientation, or disability.  Any form of harassment will not be tolerated.

### Evaluation of Instruction
Lone Star College-University Park is committed to student success.  As part of its institutional effectiveness efforts, our instructors are assessed in several ways.  For the continuous improvement of our instruction, all students are required to provide input for each course they take each semester using the Course Evaluations Questionnaire, which can be accessed on-line for each course.  This occurs approximately half way through your course and your instructor will provide you more information on this process.  Once you evaluate your course, print and turn in the receipt of completion to your instructor.  The college deans review these evaluations each semester.  The deans and/or department chairs may visit each instructor’s class at some time during the semester to observe the instructional environment being provided and complete an assessment of the instructor.
