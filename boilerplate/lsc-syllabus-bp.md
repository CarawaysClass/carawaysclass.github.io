### GradUP
<img style="float:right" src="boilerplate/gradup-logo.png">
The LSC-University Park community is here to support you and we encourage you to graduate! Many of you come to a community college because it provides an open door and it makes sense financially. What you may not realize is what attaining an associate’s or workforce degree can do for you. Below are just some of the reasons why a degree is a positive move for your life and career:
1. You’ll be eligible for more jobs.
1. You could have higher earning potential.
1. You can finish in two years or less.
1. You have options for career paths.
1. You can discover what you want from your academic program and career.
1. You can apply for additional scholarships.
1. Many of the colleges in Texas have articulation agreements with community colleges that allow you to receive full credit for the courses you have completed.
1. Your transfer acceptance is higher with an associate’s degree.

If you have any questions or need guidance with your academic plan and graduation, please ask for assistance. There are resources, advisors, and additional materials available to you. Because your academic success is important, Lone Star College fosters and commits to a set of cultural beliefs.

These free services are available to currently enrolled Lone Star College students to support academic success.

### Academic Coaching: Writing, Math, and Science
Academic Coaching includes elements of traditional tutoring but focuses on the goals and the process of teaching students to become more effective learners over the course of their studies. Academic Coaching provides academic support for subjects virtually through an online platform called Upswing. This support comes in the form of live coaches as well as a variety of tools and resources to support your academic success.
Academic Coaching aids with writing assignments and the writing process. Assistance in all levels of math and all areas of science is also provided.
More information, including hours, guidelines, and how to sign up for online tutoring, can be found online at <a href="https://upresearch.lonestar.edu/academiccoaching" target="_blank">https://upresearch.lonestar.edu/academiccoaching</a>.

### Assistive Technology Lab
The Assistive Technology (AT) Lab provides services for students who have accommodations that have been approved by Disabilities Services. Students should begin the process in the Disability Services Office (https://lonestar.edu/disability-services.htm).
Assistive technology is any item, piece of equipment, software program, or product system used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities. Some examples of services include note-takers, reader/scribes, digital recorders, smart pens, and text-to-speech software.
