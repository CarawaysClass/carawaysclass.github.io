<h1>Privacy and the Internet of Things - Cool or Creepy</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Often abbreviated “IOT” or “IoT”, Internet of Things is the concept where objects that are uniquely identifiable by an “address” are virtually represented in an internet-like structure, or in reality are present and connected on the Internet. A related concept is the Internet of Everything (IoE). </p>

<p>When IOT was first conceived, tech professionals assumed that some form of radio frequency identification (RFID) would be built into or tagged on items, objects, and people, so that they could be inventoried and monitored. You may have heard of big box stores (like Target, Wal-Mart, BestBuy, etc.) that place an RFI inside each item’s packaging, so they can electronically monitor inventory inside huge warehouses. </p>

<p>More recently, identifying items has expanded into several forms of what’s called “machine-readable tracking”: near-field communications (such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi), bar codes (which have been around for a long time), QR codes (the square blocks that looks very digitized and are usually printed in black and white), and a form of low-power radio devises (known as “chirp networks”). </p>

<p>What kinds of objects are we talking about, already or potentially in the future? A few examples include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Home Monitoring and Security system components</li>
<li>Cars, motorcycles, trucks</li>
<li>iPads and other tablets</li>
<li>Smart watches</li>
<li>Fitbit and FuelBand</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications of the Internet of Things include:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Computer chip under the skin that provides real-time vital signs to self-trackers and medical providers, including some pacemakers that can now self-report to medical professionals.</li>
<li>Milk cartons containing sensors that send signals to the homeowner or grocery store when they are nearly empty. A refrigerator may even have a smart sensor that reads the full/empty status of all the packages grocery items contained inside the fridge. Imagine being able to walk into the grocery store and use a smartphone app to talk to your fridge and discover in real-time whether you need to buy</li>
<li>Remote control smartphone, tablet, and web apps that allow users’ phones to monitor and control household activities, from pre-heating the oven, to arming your burglar alarm, to starting your clothes washer.</li>
<li>Sensors on infrastructure – like bridges, tunnels, elevators, escalators, and subway cars – that give regular readings on wear and tear and provide alerts when repairs are needed.</li>
<li>Smart appliances, working with smart electric grids, which run themselves or perform their chores after peak electric demand subsides.</li>
<li>Smart jewelry that can alert you with different color lights or light patterns when you receive a text message, email, or have been tagged in a social media posting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consider This</h2>

<p>These devices collect and generate data that is transmitted through the Internet and/or radio waves, and this data goes somewhere. That could be a trusted company, or it could be intercepted, analyzed, used or sold for some advantage – perhaps by someone with less-than-good intentions. For instance, what happens if your in-home monitoring camera gets hacked, and someone halfway across the world can watch you and your family move around inside your home? </p>

<h2>Assignment Tasks</h2>

<ol>
<li>Visit the list of IoT devices (<a href="http://iotlist.co/">http://iotlist.co/</a>) and select one device that interests you.</li>
<li>Create a post in the #iotprivacy Slack channel where you&#8230;</li>
<li>Consider whether you view this device is either Cool or Creepy.</li>
<li>Explain what privacy concerns/implications this device has.</li>
<li>Describe how this could be used for other than what was intended by its manufacturer.</li>
<li>Share your thoughts on at least one of your classmate&#8217;s posts in this same channel.</li>
</ol>

<p>This assignment is worth 20 points and will be evaluated based on how well your Slack post addresses the previous prompts.</p>

<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create your post in the #iotprivacy channel.</li>
<li>Post a response to one of your classmates in the same channel.</li>
