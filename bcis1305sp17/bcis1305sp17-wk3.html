<h2>Week 3 - Using Tables, Columns, and Graphics in Word, File Management, and Capstone 1</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In our 3rd week, we complete our investigation of Microsoft Word. Tables, columns, and graphics enhance the appearance and readability of your Word documents. For example, you can use tables to attractively arrange and align information in column and row format, and columns improve readability and provide additional white space in a document. You can also insert and manipulate graphics to add attention-grabbing visual elements to your documents. This week we introduce the Word tools that allow you to add and customize tables, columns, and graphics. Finally, we will work on the first of our Capstone projects. </p>
