<h2>Capstone Project: Databases</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this project, you will demonstrate the database-related knowledge and skills that you have recently learned. In this capstone project, you get to construct your own specific Airtable database.</p>

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>At the end of this project, you will be able to:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Create a new relational database made up of two or more tables</li>
<li>Design your database tables to house specific information for your application</li>
<li>Add fields of specific data types</li>
<li>Construct relationships (or links) between tables</li>
<li>Input your own personal data into the database tables</li>
<li>Use the Airtable system and its interface functionality</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assignment Tasks</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>If you haven't already, <a href="https://airtable.com/signup" target="_blank">sign up</a> for a free account Airtable account and be sure to read through the <a href="https://guide.airtable.com" target="_blank">Guide to Airtable</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new database (referred to as a "base" in Airtable) for a set of information that is of interest to you.  You may use the data and spreadsheets from our second Capstone 2 as inspiration for this project.  Depending on what you did Capstone 2, you may be able to use some or all of that data in this database.</p></li>
<li><p>...or, if you are unable to apply your specific capstone 2 data, take a look at the extensive list of <a href="https://airtable.com/templates" target="_blank">templates</a> and find one  that would be valuable to you. You may also create a new base from scratch if you have an idea for something altogether new.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimally your database should have the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>3 or more tables</li>
	<li>Each table should have at least 3 or more fields</li>
	<li>At least one relationship (link) between two of your tables</li>
	<li>At least 20 records cumulative across all of your tables</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
