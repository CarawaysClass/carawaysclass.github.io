<h2>Week 14 - Databases and Coding</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Databases make it easy for you to ensure your data are accurate, organized, and usable. This chapter covers the basics of working with a relational database and using the Access database management system.
Only a few decades ago, a computer was considered to be an island with only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk. Now, through communication networks and the Internet, individual computers have direct electronic access to almost unlimited sources of information.</p>

<p>In today’s world, almost all information is stored in databases. They are an important part of nearly every organization including schools, hospitals, and banks. To effectively compete in today’s world, you need to know how to find information and understand how it is stored.</p>

<p>Why should you need to know anything about programming? The answer is simple. You might need to deal with programmers in the course of your work. You also may be required to do some programming yourself in the future. A growing trend is toward end user software development. This means that end users, like you, are developing their own application programs.</p>
