<h2>Week 13 - Emerging Technology</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Technology is ever changing and it continues to expand into more  areas of our lives each day.  Though, we often focus on the personal aspects of its effect, technology is certainly changing the way in which we work.  As a new college student, you may have yet to enter the workforce.  Or, perhaps, you may be a student who has returned to college with the goal of developing a new skillset.  Either way, it is important for us to consider how technology is molding, if not completely redefining, what our jobs will look like in the future.</p>
<p>This week we investigate a variety of emerging technologies and consider their potential impact on our work today and in the future.  These technologies include:</p>  
<ul>
<li>3D Scanning</li>
<li>3D Printing</li>
<li>Virtual Reality</li>
<li>Augmented Reality</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Digital Assistants (e.g., Amazon Echo)</li>
<li>Inexpensive Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino)</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies are finding their way into new areas of our lives and being applied to our work.  These changes are also prompting us to consider the ethical and moral impact of these technologies as they make their way into our personal and professional lives.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>At the end of this week, you will be able to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Identify different types and examples of Emerging Technologies.</li>
<li>Describe how certain Emerging Technologies work and how they are used.</li>
<li>Describe the effect of Emerging Technologies on our personal lives.</li>
<li>Explain how Emerging Technologies are impacting our work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>

<ol>
<li>Spend at least an hour (but more is encouraged) in the <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/news/28315.htm" target="_blank">Innovation Room</a> found on the 7th floor of Building 13 familiarizing yourself with the different technologies found there.  </li>
<li>For my online students who may not have the option to visit the University Park campus, I've provided several resource links below for you to begin learning about some of the technologies.</li>
<li>Do your own research on those two or three technologies that interest you.  Feel free to share your coolest findings in the #general Slack channel - this isn't required but encouraged! </li>
</ol>
