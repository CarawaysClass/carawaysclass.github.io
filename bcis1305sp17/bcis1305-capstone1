<h3>Assignment Tasks</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose one of the following document types for your project. <em>Yes, you get to choose the one you want to write!</em> Feel free to choose the type of document where you may have already created a similar document before, e.g., your resume, or where you already have some or most of the information available. Be sure that you create a document that is your own work - i.e., be original and avoid the temptation to just copy someone else&#8217;s work. Here are the types of documents that you can choose from: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><strong>Professional Resume</strong> create a Word document of your own professional resume. This should include all details about your education and work experience. Be sure to note any important experiences and/or accomplishments that you have had. Consider adding a profile photo and embedding hyperlinks to related information such as your employers&#8217; or schools&#8217; website.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural Document</strong> create a Word document that describes a procedure, a process, or a series of instructions in specific detail. This should include at least three levels of document hierarchy (hint: heading 1, heading 2, heading 3, etc.) with related styling and indentions based on tab stops. Consider creating a set of instructions that you may have to follow at work or some procedure that you follow each day like your daily tasks. It should be a procedure or process that you know personally and thoroughly.</li>
<li><strong>Questionnaire or Survey</strong> create an easy-to-follow questionnaire or survey that could be used to gather information about some subject or experience. Consider using either tables or nested answer options (think multiple-choice and/or multi-select questions). You should use appropriate checkbox symbols, short-answer blanks, and long-answer text areas. For surveys that have many questions, consider using a table in your document to improve readability and ease-of-use by your survey subjects.</li>
<li><strong>Topical Outline</strong> create a complete and thorough outline for a specific topic. This should include at least three levels of outline hierarchy with related styling and indentions based on tab stops. Consider creating an outline that details the information for a chapter or unit covered in a class that you are taking. Or, create an outline for a paper or project that you are currently working on in another class.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Using Microsoft Word, create a document (based on the type you selected in step 1) that is <em>between 2 to 5 pages in length</em>. The content of the document should be original and not a straight copy of someone else&#8217;s work. You can certainly reference other works - just be sure to properly cite those resources.</p></li>
<li>In creating your document, include at least 6 of the following 10 key features/functionalities of Word (the corresponding SIMBook SLO is in parentheses):

<ol>
<li>Custom Document Properties (SLO 1.7) and Document Property Fields (SLO 3.7)</li>
<li>Nested / hierarchical text using Custom Indentions (2.3) and Tab Stops (2.4)</li>
<li>Section Breaks (2.5) with specific styling (2.7)</li>
