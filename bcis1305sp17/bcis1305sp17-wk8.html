<h2>Week 8 - Privacy, Ethics, and Security</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>There are more than one billion personal computers in use today. What are the consequences of the widespread presence of this technology? Does technology make it easy for others to invade our personal privacy? When we apply for a loan or for a driver’s license, or when we check out at the supermarket, is that information about us being distributed and used without our permission? When we use the web, is information about us being collected and shared with others?</p>

<p>This technology prompts lots of questions—very important questions. Perhaps these are some of the most important questions for the 21st century. To efficiently and effectively use computers, we need to be aware of the potential impact of technology on people and how to protect yourself on the web. We need to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about personal privacy and organizational security.</p>
