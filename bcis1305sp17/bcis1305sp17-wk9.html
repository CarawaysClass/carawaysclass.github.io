<h2>Week 9 - System Software and Application Software</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>When most people think about computers, they think about surfing the web, writing papers, e-mailing friends, chatting online, making presentations, and any number of other valuable applications. We typically think about applications and application software. Computers and computer applications have become a part of the fabric of our everyday lives. We usually do not think about the more mundane and behind-the-scenes computer activities: loading and running programs, coordinating networks that share resources, organizing files, protecting our computers from viruses, performing periodic maintenance to avoid problems, and controlling hardware devices so that they can communicate with one another. Typically, these activities go on behind the scenes without our help.
Not long ago, trained specialists were required to perform many of the operations you can now do with a personal computer. Market analysts used calculators to project sales. Graphic artists created designs by hand. Data processing clerks created electronic files to be stored on large computers. Now you can do all these tasks—and many others—with a personal computer and the appropriate application software.</p>
