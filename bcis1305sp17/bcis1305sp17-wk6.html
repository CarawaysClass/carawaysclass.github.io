<h2>Week 6 - MS Excel and Screencasting</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In addition to building formulas and functions in a worksheet, you can use Excel to graph or chart data. After selecting values and labels, you can quickly create a professional looking chart with a few clicks of the mouse. This chapter introduces you to the basics of creating, editing, and formatting Excel charts.
Excel can use data from many sources as well as provide data to other programs. When data is shared among applications, the data is usually in a list or table layout like a database.
