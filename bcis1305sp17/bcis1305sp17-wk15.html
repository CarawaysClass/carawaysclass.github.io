<h2>Week 15 - Coding and the Integrated Project</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The end of the semester looms ahead leaving us just enough time to complete our final assignments and to take an oh so brief look at our final "new" topic of coding.</p>
<p>
Why should you need to know anything about coding (i.e., programming)? The answer is simple. You might need to deal with programmers one dayin your work. Or, you may someday find yourself rolling up your sleeves to begin coding yourself. There's a growing trend toward end user software development. This means that end users, like you, are developing their own application programs.  Essentially, "scratching their own itch".</p>
<p> In fact, you've even done some coding in our class already when you were building formulas and other logic in your Excel spreadhseets!
</p>
