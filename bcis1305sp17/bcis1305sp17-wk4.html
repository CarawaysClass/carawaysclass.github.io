<h2>Week 4 - System Unit and Input/Output</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This week, we switch gears and focus on some non-Office specific topics. First, we will look at the System Unit, or main hardware component of a computer. System units are getting smaller, faster, cheaper, and more powerful. These improvements are resulting in microchips finding their way into many aspects of our lives. Later in the week, Input and Output become our topic of attention. The input and output devices that we use continue to evolve. A typical cell phone now has dozens of input sensors and display options. Augmented reality displays or wearable glasses will integrate what you see with extensive databases of relevant information.</p>
