The pages found in this repository are embeddable content segments used in conjunction with the Learning Management System (LMS) that I use at Lone Star College.  Currently, that is Brightspace (by D2L).  The reason why this content is being maintained in github vs. directly in the LMS is two-fold:

1. Brightspace does not provide a private, reusable content item that can be shared across courses.  This results in my having to maintain multiple copies of repeating content like my "Instructor Info" page.  If I find that I need to make a change or update that content, I have to visit each instance in order to keep things updated and consistent.  
2. As institutions of learning are apt to do, there is a good chance that the LMS that we are currently using will someday change.  Preparing for that possiblity, I am looking for ways that I can keep my course content LMS-agnostic.  This github repository provides an LMS-independent repository for this repeating content.
