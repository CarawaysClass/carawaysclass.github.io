<h2>Week 4 - Consolidating, Linking, and Inserting Objects | Exploring the Function Library</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>When multiple worksheets have identical layouts and labels, you can summarize data with the Consolidate command. You can also link to data in a different workbook to build a formula or display information. In this chapter, you will learn how to consolidate data from multiple sheets in the same workbook and how to link multiple workbooks with an external reference formula. You will also insert SmartArt graphics, screenshots, and hyperlinks in a worksheet.
The Excel Function Library includes functions that perform complex and sophisticated calculations for use in business, government, education, and research. In this chapter, you learn about functions in the Database, Logical, Date &amp; Time, Financial, and Text categories. You also nest functions and build time, date, and statistical calculations.</p>
