## Course Evaluation for Extra Credit

One of the biggest favors you can do for me, is to complete a course evaluation. 

Here's how you can help me do that: 

1. Log in to <a href="https://my.lonestar.edu" target="_blank">myLoneStar</a>.  
2. Click the 'Enrollment' button in the left-hand navigation menu.  
3. Click the 'Course Evaluations' link in the drop-down menu.  
4. Click on our course name and begin answering questions.  

When completing your evaluation, please consider all aspects of our class, e.g.:   

- the overall class experience  
- value of the course topics that we covered, e.g., LinkedIn, Word, Excel, Airtable, etc.    
- your LSC online experience, i.e., D2L  
- usefulness of using Slack for class communication    
- your experience using SIMnet    
- my teaching style (good and bad)  
- my availability     
- anything else that you feel is pertinent  
 
Please know that the Course Evaluation system keeps your comments and ratings "anonymous".  For this reason, you should feel completely comfortable giving me any and all feedback, even constructive criticism.  

As an incentive, I will add 15 points to your overall point total if you will complete this by 11:59pm on the Thursday of Finals Week.  

**IMPORTANT:**  After submitting your evaluation, you must provide with me a screenshot of your Course Evaluation Summary page showing that you have completed the task.  Please submit your screenshot into this Dropbox.
