<p>you should see some different behaviors that would be useful in your own web site. Consider how you might embellish your user&rsquo;s experience by adding a transition to a specific button or the links in your navigational menu. Could adding a transform to important content on one or more pages of your site&nbsp;help draw your user&rsquo;s attention?</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fork the above example pens to make a working copy of each in your codepen account. Experiment by changing different properties and their values to see what unique animation effects you can create.</li>
<li>Consider how you might be able to use these in your own site.</li>
<li>Start a new thread in our #css-animation Slack channel, briefly summarizing what you &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; in editing each of these pens. Share what you liked, what you didn&rsquo;t like and any &ldquo;A-ha&rdquo; discoveries that you made.</li>
<li>Based on your experimentation, add at least one transition and one transform to two or more different elements within your SiteGround-hosted website.</li>
<li>After you've added your transition and transform to your site, add a follow-up post in Slack that includes a link to your page(s) where you added the animation. Describe what effects you added to your site and any useful lessons learned.</li>
