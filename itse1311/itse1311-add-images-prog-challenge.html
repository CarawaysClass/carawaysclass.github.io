<h1>Adding Images Programming Challenge</h1>
<p>In this exercise you will create a new single HTML document that briefly introduces our ITSE 1311 course and includes information about our textbook. In addition to the textual description, you will add several images to your document.</p>
<p>For the textual content of our page, be sure to include the following items: </p>
<ul>
<li>a page title (as an h1 element)</li>
<li>a brief description of our course in your own words</li>
<li> a brief description of our textbook </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your text added to your document, it's time to add your images!</p>
<p> You should have at least three images included in this page but you can add more if you like! Minimally, you should have:</p>
<ol>
<li>An image that makes up either the <strong>header or logo image </strong>of your page. Similar to what we saw in exercises 4-4 and 4-5, this logo should appear above your page title. This could be an image that you "find" on the web - possibly something from Lone Star College or a computer or some code, etc. </li>
<li>A <strong>personal image</strong> that you have taken with your own camera that pertains to our course. This could be an image of you working at your computer or a photo of one of the pages of our text, e.g., the Chapter 7 cover page (p. 123) or whatever you can come up with.</li>
<li>A <strong>linked image</strong> that isn't stored in your directory but is actually "referenced" from a remote source. I have created one for you here:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://brucec.siteground.net/itse1311/lwd-book.png" target="_self">http://brucec.siteground.net/itse1311/lwd-book.png</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This image should then be hyperlinked to the book's web page: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.learningwebdesign.com/" target="_blank">http://www.learningwebdesign.com/</a></p>
<p><em>Make sure your images are appropriately sized and aligned.</em></p>
<p>Save your file as <strong>course.html</strong> and upload this with your logo and personal images (and any other resource files) your SiteGround hosting service. Submit your work by sharing the URL to this page in the #add-images Slack channel. </p>
