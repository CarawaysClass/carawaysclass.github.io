<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We now shift our focus to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) and how they are used to change the look and even the behavior of our websites. </p>

<p>Even though it has been around since 2003, the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> website still serves as a great example of what can be done with CSS and well structured HTML. </p>

<p>When we separate content and its structure (HTML) from our design (CSS), it gives us extensive flexibility in how we design and deliver the layout and overall user experience to those that visit our websites. </p>
