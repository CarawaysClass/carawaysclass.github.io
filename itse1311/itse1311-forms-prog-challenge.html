<h1>Forms Programming Challenge</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using a starting "template" file, create a Contact Form on your SiteGround hosted site.</li>
<li>Customize the fields that are included in your form.</li>
<li>Test your form to insure that it emails the contact info to your email address.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time to complete: 30 min</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In Chapter 9, we&nbsp;cover the topic of&nbsp;Forms and how they can be used to collect information from visitors to our website. To make&nbsp;our form really work for us, we need to deploy it to our&nbsp;SiteGround&nbsp;server so that we can take advantage of server-based scripting to generate and send an email notifiying us the users that complete our contact form. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download a working copy of the SG-contact.php file (your instructor will provide the link). Rename this file to be:  contact.php
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let's customize the form by changing/adding the following fields to the contact form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the email field to an HTML5 text input type of &lsquo;email&rsquo; (pg 156)</li>
<li>Add a telephone number field (with the appropriate type) to the form</li>
<li>Add either a checkbox or radio button to your form. &nbsp;It's your choice on what data will be captured with this field.</li>
<li>Add at least one more field that you think appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit line 34 in the contact.php file, replacing &lsquo;[YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE]&rsquo; with your actual email address. This is the email address where you want the contact info to be sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extra challenge: can you edit the &lsquo;send mail&rsquo; lines so that your new fields&rsquo; data is included in the email that is sent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Upload your contact.php file to your SiteGround server and test it.  Did it work?  If not, troubleshoot the issue and see if you can find the solution.</p></li>

<li><p>Submit your work by sharing the URL to this page in the #contact-form Slack channel.</p></li>
</ol>
