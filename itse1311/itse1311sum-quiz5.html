<h2>Week 5 Quiz</h2>
<p>Taking a different tack this week, you get to select one question from the following list to answer for your Quiz #5 submission. You will need to select a question that hasn't already been answered by one of your classmates so the earlier you select your question and post your answer in Slack the better! </p>
<h3>Submitting your Answer</h3>

Be sure to identify the question that you are answering by including its number at the beginning of your post.
Feel free to provide feedback to your classmates on their Question and Answer posting.</p>
