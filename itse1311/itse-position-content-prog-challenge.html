<ul>
<li>Understand how an external stylesheet (CSS) is &ldquo;linked&rdquo; and used in conjunction with an .html content file.</li>
<li>Be able to position page content using CSS.</li>

<li>Be able to identify difference between relative and absolute positioning.</li>
<li>Be able to differentiate between pixel width and percentage width.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding floats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time to complete: 60 min</h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Using a partially completed .html and .css file set (derived from the the Jenware example of chapters 14 and 15), you will make the necessary corrections to the markup (html) and add the necessary styling (css) to make your page match a demonstrated final version of the tshirts4all.com products page similar to the Jenware.com products page.</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and unzip the starter tshirts4all.zip file (included below). This includes the .html, .css and other resources required to complete this assignment.</li>
<li>View this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://v.usetapes.com/ujlnI44Tlh" target="_blank">short screencast</a> demonstrating the completed page and its behavior.</li>
<li>Using your text editor, open the newproducts.html and style.com documents.</li>
<li>Update the markup (html) to properly reference the image files - these are currently displayed as broken images when the newproducts.html page is opened in a browser.</li>
<li>Update the &ldquo;Site hand-crafted&hellip;&rdquo; link at the bottom of the page to reference you and your SiteGround-hosted site.</li>
<li>Following the CSS-specific Exercise steps 14&ndash;2, 14&ndash;3, 15&ndash;1 thru 15&ndash;5 (in our text), apply the necessary styling to make your page match what was demonstrated in step 2. Note that style.css is a complete (and long) stylesheet file - all of your edits should come below line number 490 (i.e., the content above line 490 should remain as-is and intact).</li>
<li>When you are done, zip up your completed solution including your .html file, your .css file, and any resource folder(s) and upload the resulting .zip file into the corresponding dropbox found in D2L.</li>
