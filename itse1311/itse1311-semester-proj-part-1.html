<h1>ITSE 1311 Beginning Web Programming Semester Project - Part 1</h1>
<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>This assignment is worth 180 points. In this project you will create two design design documents of your site. &nbsp;You will also begin to build out the rest of your personal web site based on this design.</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a site map of each of the pages of your site using a tool like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://lucidchart.com" target="_blank">Lucidchart</a>&nbsp;or even pen and paper. &nbsp;This site map should, at a minimum, identify each of the pages of your site and briefly describe what is found on those pages.</li>
<li>Create a wireframe of each of the pages of your site. &nbsp;Again, you may use a tool like Lucidchart or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gomockingbird.com/home" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a>, or even pen and paper. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Construct the initially draft pages of your site and upload these to your SiteGround.com hosted site, building on what you have already deployed there.</li>
<li>Though this isn't the final version of your site, be consistent in the set of fonts and colors that you use in the creation of these page.</li>
<li>Be consistent in the set of navigation buttons (i.e., your menu) that should appear across all of the&nbsp;pages of your site. The placement of these should also be consistent between pages.</li>
<li>Your site should consist of <em>at least</em>&nbsp;4 pages, including the Home (index.html) and Contact page. You can include your Resume page if that still &ldquo;fits&rdquo; within the overall goal your website.</li>
<li>Use an external style sheet for the majority of your styling.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li>Upload a copy of your site map into this dropbox. &nbsp;If you used the "pen and paper" approach, scan your map and upload that into the dropbox.</li>
<li>Upload a copy of your wireframe into this dropbox. &nbsp;If you used the "pen and paper" approach, scan your diagram&nbsp;and upload that into the dropbox.</li>
<li>Include the URL to your site as a comment when you upload your file.</li>
</ol>
