<p>For online discussions and conversations, we will&nbsp;use a communication tool called&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>. &nbsp;Slack is used by teams around the world to collaborate and share ideas. &nbsp;Slack will be&nbsp;online forum where you can ask questions of me or of your classmates. &nbsp;It makes it easy to quickly communicate between team members (in our class, that's you, me, and your classmates). &nbsp;It also provides an easy-to-use system where you can go back and search for topics and shared information.</p>
<p>I will also assign an occasional discussion topic where you will&nbsp;share our thoughts in Slack!</p>
