<h2 id="whendoestheinstructorwork">When does the instructor work?</h2>

<p>Generally, I am working Monday through Friday (noon). I will check in some over the weekends, but may or may not grade, answer questions, post News updates, etc. All of my pertinent contact information is posted under Instructor Info. </p>

<h2 id="howlongwillihavetowaitbeforemyassignmentgradeisposted">How long will I have to wait before my assignment grade is posted?</h2>

<p>My goal is to grade and return assignments back to you ASAP. In most cases, you should expect a 3&#8211;5 day turnaround. If the assignment has a higher complexity or is just &#8220;bigger&#8221;, it may take me longer to get the grade back to you. If you have not received your grade in a reasonable amount of time, please feel free to contact me. I will be happy to update you on my grading progress. </p>

<h2 id="thisismyfirstonlineclass">This is my first online or technology-rich course, am I ready?</h2>

<p>I know many students are anxious when they sign up for their first online class.  Similarly, the classes that I teach are usually "technology-rich" so this, too, can create uncertaintly on the first day or two of class.  To help you better prepare for our class and to determine if you are ready for an online class, feel free to use the <a href="http://lonestar.readi.info/index.cfm?fuseaction=loginscreen" target="_blank">SmarterMeasure self-assessment tool</a>.

<h2 id="doineedtopurchasebooksforthiscourseafterallitisonline">Do I need to purchase books for this course? After all, it is online!</h2>

<p>Usually, the answer is 'Yes, you will need to purchase your textbook.'  This semster I am piloting (i.e., trying out) a new digital textbook from McGraw-Hill and they are providing free access for my students.  Pretty cool, huh?!?  :)</p>

<h2 id="whatdoidoifigetreallybehind">What do I do if I get really behind?</h2>
