<h2 id="whendoestheinstructorwork">When does my instructor work?</h2>

<p>Generally, I am working Monday through Friday (noon). I will check in some over the weekends, but may or may not grade, answer questions, post News updates, etc. All of my pertinent contact information is posted under Instructor Info. </p>

<h2 id="howlongwillihavetowaitbeforemyassignmentgradeisposted">How long will I have to wait before my assignment grade is posted?</h2>

<p>My goal is to grade and return assignments back to you ASAP. In most cases, you should expect a 3&#8211;5 day turnaround. If the assignment has a higher complexity or is just &#8220;bigger&#8221;, it may take me longer to get the grade back to you. If you have not received your grade in a reasonable amount of time, please feel free to contact me. I will be happy to update you on my grading progress. </p>
