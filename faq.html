<h2 id="whendoestheinstructorwork">When does my instructor work?</h2>

<p>Generally, I work from Monday through Friday (noon).  During summer semesters, Monday through Thursday. The best way to reach me is via Slack.  </p>

<h2 id="howlongwillihavetowaitbeforemyassignmentgradeisposted">How long will I have to wait before my assignment grade is posted?</h2>

<p>My goal is to grade and return assignments back to you ASAP. In most cases, you should expect a 3&#8211;5 day turnaround. If the assignment has a higher complexity or is just &#8220;bigger&#8221;, it may take me longer to get the grade back to you. If you have not received your grade in a reasonable amount of time, please feel free to contact me. I will be happy to update you on my progress. </p>

<h2 id="thisismyfirstonlineclass">This is my first online or technology-rich course, am I ready?</h2>

<p>I know many students are anxious when they sign up for their first online class.  Similarly, the classes that I teach are usually "technology-rich" so this, too, can create uncertaintly on the first day or two of class.  To help you better prepare for our class and to determine if you are ready for an online class, feel free to use the <a href="https://lonestar.smartermeasure.com" target="_blank">SmarterMeasure self-assessment tool</a>.  SmarterMeasure is a tool which helps you determine your level of readiness for taking online or technology rich courses.  SmarterMeasure is a tool to help you succeed!</p>

<h2 id="arethereanyduedatesforthiscourse">Are there any due dates for this course?</h2>

<p>Yes, for my classes where we use SIMnet (BCIS 1305), the due dates are maintained in that system.  Otherwise, due dates will be posted in Brightspace or Slack. In addition to due dates, be sure you keep an eye on Slack for reminders, updates, and changes throughout the semester. </p>

<h2 id="doineedtopurchasebooksforthiscourseafterallitisonline">Do I need to purchase books for this course? </h2>

<p>Yes, you should purchase the textbook.  Please see our Syllabus for the specifics.</p>

<h2 id="doineedtoownacomputerforthiscourse">Do I need to own a computer for this course?</h2>

<p>You do not need to own a computer, but you will need to have access to one. There are computers available on all LSC campuses.  No exception will be made for students without reliable access to a computer. After all, this is a computer course. </p>

<h2 id="whatdoidoifigetreallybehind">What do I do if I get really behind?</h2>

<p>As long as you stay on task and follow the recommended due dates, you should not fall behind. If, at any time, you feel that you are struggling and need help getting back on track, please contact me. </p>

<h2 id="howdoiknowwhatimadeintheclass">How do I know what I made in the class?</h2>

<p>I will update and publish your grades throughout the semester in an online gradebook.  For BCIS 1305 and ITSW 1304, the gradebook will be maintained in <strong>SIMnet</strong>  For my programming classes like ITSE 1302, 1311, and 2302, the gradebook will be maintained in <strong>Codio</strong>.</p>
