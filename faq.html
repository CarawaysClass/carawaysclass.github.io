## When does the instructor work?    

Generally, I am working Monday through Friday (noon).  I will check in some over the weekends, but may or may not grade, answer questions, post News updates, etc.  All of my pertinent contact information is posted under Instructor Info.  

## How long will I have to wait before my assignment grade is posted?  

My goal is to always grade and return assignments back to you ASAP. In most cases, you should expect a 3-5 day turnaround.  If the assignment has a higher complexity or just "bigger", it may take me longer to get the grade back to you.  If you have not received your grade in a reasonable amount of time, please feel free to contact me.  I will be happy to update you on my grading progress.  

## How can the student help the instructor?  

Please include your last name and assignment title on all work.  Instead of using spaces in the filename, use camel casing, where the first letter of the file is lowercase and each subsequent word is capitalized. For example, Smith Assignment 1.rtf would become **smithAssignment1.rtf**.  

## Are there any due dates for this course?  

Check the syllabus for these absolute due dates. There are also recommended or suggested due dates that will help you stay on track. Make sure you keep an eye on the News tool, the discussion board, and your D2L email for reminders, updates, and changes throughout the semester.  

## Do I need to purchase books for this course? After all, it is online!  

Yes. Since there is no lecture time or lab time scheduled for an online course, this is the only way for you to receive the required information for this course. You can rent or purchase your book and required software from the bookstore or another vendor (i.e. Amazon).  As long as you get the exact same book and the required software, you are free to choose where you want to make that purchase.   

## Can I buy used books for this course?  

Absolutely, as long as the book has all the pages.  Allowance will __not__ be made for a used purchase. If you do not already own the software, you will need to purchase it. You MUST use Visual Logic. No exceptions.   

## Do I need to own a computer for this course?  

You do not need to own a computer, but you will need to have access to one so that you can  install and use the software for this course.  No exception will be made for students without reliable access to a computer.  After all, this is a computer course.  

## What do I do if I get really behind?  

As long as you stay on task and follow the recommended due dates, you should not fall behind. If, at any time, you feel that you are struggling and need help getting back on track, please contact me.   

## How do I know what I made in the class?  

Visit the __Grades__ page (found in the menubar above). All grades for this course will be posted there.  You will have access to your grades all semester.  Grading normally takes 3-5 days, with the exception of holidays.  

## I'm not that familiar with D2L, how do I  turn in assignments?  

We will use the dropbox feature to submit your assignments. You can find step-by-step instructions under the __Resources__ &gt; __D2L__  module to the left.
