<h3>
You're likely asking yourself "Why do we have a 'Week 0'?"
</h3>
<p>I've decided to designate the week of Sept 4th as Week 0.  We have all been impacted by Hurricane Harvey in some way.  Many are still trying to pick themselves up and figure out what they have that hasn't been touched by the flood waters.  For this reason, we'll use week 0 to assess how everyone is doing and to get everyone ready to formally start our class next week (September 11th).  </p>
<p>One way you can help me in this assessment is to complete this short <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QMZPV2F" target="_blank">Student Status survey</a>.  Your responses will not be shared with your classmates.  Your responses will help me to understand what you are currently facing and will allow me to better structure our class as we begin our semester.  <strong>I've also emailed this survey link to your email so you may have already completed it by the time you read this.</strong> </p>
<p> For now, you can visit the "Start Here!" content section (above) and work through those items.  Week 1 is also open if you want to begin working through that section now.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you run into any issues or challenges - whether it's your computer, your internet connection, our online textbook, or anything else, I'm here to help.</p>
