<h2>Week 3 - Using Tables, Columns, and Graphics in Word, File Management, and Capstone 1</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In our 3rd week, we begin by looking at Microsoft Office 2016 and then work through Chapters 1 and 2 of Microsoft Word 2016. First, we look at creating, opening, and saving a Word document. Additionally, we investigate the paragraph and formatting functionality that is essential to a word processing software like Word.  Once we have the basics in place, we look at the layout, margins, pagination, and page and section breaks.  These powerful features of Word can make your life much easier when working with longer, multi-page documents. </p>
<p> Using Styles and Word&#8217;s document design tools can take your Word document to the next level. Later, we will look at some of the tools found in Word that help in the creation of citations, bibliographies, endnotes, footnotes, headers, footers, and table of contents.</p>  

 we complete our investigation of Microsoft Word. Tables, columns, and graphics enhance the appearance and readability of your Word documents. For example, you can use tables to attractively arrange and align information in column and row format, and columns improve readability and provide additional white space in a document. You can also insert and manipulate graphics to add attention-grabbing visual elements to your documents. This week we introduce the Word tools that allow you to add and customize tables, columns, and graphics. Finally, we will work on the first of our Capstone projects. </p>
