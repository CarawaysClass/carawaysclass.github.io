<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In our 3rd week, we begin by looking at Microsoft Office 2016 and then work through Chapters 1 and 2 of Microsoft Word 2016. First, we look at creating, opening, and saving a Word document. Additionally, we investigate the paragraph and formatting functionality that is essential to a word processing software like Word.</p>
