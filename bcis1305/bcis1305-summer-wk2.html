<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Microsoft PowerPoint is the leading presentation software. Whether you need to create a quick display or a very polished presentation with dazzling graphics, creative animation effects, and video, PowerPoint has all the tools you need. You can use PowerPoint for slide shows with computer projection equipment in meeting rooms, for self-running presentations viewed by individuals, or for presentations shown on the web.</p>
<p>PowerPoint gives you the ability to create information graphics—to visually display information in ways that help an audience quickly grasp the concepts you are presenting. You can choose from many options, such as adding shapes or color for emphasis, pictures to illustrate, diagrams to show processes, and charts to show data relationships.</p>
<p>In our third chapter of PowerPoint, you will learn how to create new theme colors customized for your topic, apply animation, and link to a video from a web site. You also explore PowerPoint’s rehearsal features to help you perfect your delivery timing and techniques, project your presentation more effectively, and prepare a presentation to be self-running.</p> 
<p>Tying it all together, you will work on the second of our Capstone projects - this one focuses on PowerPoint.</p>
<p>We also spend some time this week creating and customizing a LinkedIn profile for you. LinkedIn is a professional social network where you should begin building your presence.</p>
