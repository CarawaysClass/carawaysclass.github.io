<h3>Overview</h3>

Why should you need to know anything about programming (i.e., coding)? The answer is simple. You might need to deal with programmers one day in your work. Or, you may someday find yourself rolling up your sleeves to begin coding yourself. There's a growing trend toward end-user software development. This means that end users, like you, are developing their own application programs.  Essentially, "scratching their own itch".</p>
<p> In fact, you've even done some coding in our class already when you were building formulas and other logic in your Excel spreadsheets!
