<h3>Overview</h3>

Why should you need to know anything about programming (i.e., coding)? The answer is simple. You might need to work with a programmer some day in your work. Or, you even find yourself rolling up your sleeves and begin coding yourself. There's a growing trend toward end-user software development. This means that end users, like you, are developing their own programs and writing their own code.  Essentially, "scratching their own itch".</p>
<p> In fact, you've even done some coding in our class already when you were building the formulas and other logic in your Excel spreadsheets!
</p>
This week we take a deeper look at the topic of computer programming with the goal of understanding its importance while also giving you a taste of what it means to write a bit code.
