<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">MS Excel & Privacy, Ethics, and Security</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>There are more than one billion personal computers in use today. What are the consequences of the widespread presence of this technology? Does technology make it easy for others to invade our personal privacy? When we use the web, is information about us being collected and shared with others?</p>

<p>To efficiently and effectively use computers, we need to be aware of the potential impact of technology on people and how to protect yourself on the web. We need to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about personal privacy and organizational security.</p>

<p>Microsoft Excel (Excel) is spreadsheet software for creating an electronic workbook. A workbook consists of rows and columns used to organize data, perform calculations, print reports, and build charts. With Excel, you can create simple to complex personal or business workbooks. This chapter presents basic procedures for creating and editing an Excel workbook.</p>
<p>With its capabilities in mathematical, scientific, engineering, and other calculations, Excel is a valuable tool for business, government, education, and you. You can use Excel to create a simple addition formula or a sophisticated calculation with layers of arithmetic. In this chapter, you learn how to build a basic formula and how to use mathematical rules. You also explore Excel function categories.</p>
