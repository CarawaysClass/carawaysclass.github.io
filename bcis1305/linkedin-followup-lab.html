<h2>Your LinkedIn Profile Should Grow With You</h3> 

<p>As you develop new skills, acquire knowledge, and build experiences, you should always consider adding these to your LinkedIn profile.  It is also a good practice to read through your LI profile regularly (i.e., every month or two) making sure it is complete, up-to-date, and reflects your current professional persona.</p> 
<h2> Learning Activities  </h2>

<h2>Assignment Tasks</h2>
 
<ol>
<li>Review the grading feedback I provided in your initial LI lab assignment.  Were there things that you could improve/correct, e.g., photo, personalized URL, grammatical or spelling issues?</li>
<li>Considering the new skills you've learned in this class (Word, PowerPoint, etc.), how should your LI profile reflect these? Are there new skills and/or knowledge that you have now acquired in other classes or in your current job?  Do you currently find these in your LI profile?</li>  
<li>Have a new job? Joined a new organization? Changed your major to IT because you love BCIS so much?  :)</li>
<li>There's something you can add or update in your LI profile - make those changes!</li>  
</ol>

 
<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>   

<ol>
<li>Send me a direct message in Slack letting me know that your LI profile is ready for review.</li>
<li>In the same direct message, provide a short description of the things you've added or changed in your profile.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lab assignment is worth 20 Points.</p>
