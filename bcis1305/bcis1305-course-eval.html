<h2 id="courseevaluationforextracredit">Course Evaluation for Extra Credit</h2>

<p>One of the biggest favors you can do for me, is to complete a course evaluation. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how you can help me do that: </p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to <a href="https://my.lonestar.edu" target="_blank">myLoneStar</a>.</li>
<li>Click the &#8216;Enrollment&#8217; button in the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li>Click the &#8216;Course Evaluations&#8217; link in the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Click on our course name and begin answering questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>When completing your evaluation, please consider all aspects of our class, e.g.: </p>

<ul>
<li>the overall class experience</li>
<li>value of the course topics that we covered, e.g., LinkedIn, Word, Excel, Airtable, etc.</li>
<li>your LSC online experience, i.e., D2L</li>
<li>usefulness of using Slack for class communication</li>
<li>your experience using SIMnet</li>
<li>my teaching style (good and bad)</li>
<li>my availability</li>
<li>anything else that you feel is pertinent</li>
</ul>

<p>Please know that the Course Evaluation system keeps your comments and ratings &#8220;anonymous&#8221;. For this reason, you should feel completely comfortable giving me any and all feedback, even constructive criticism. </p>

<p>As an incentive, I will add 10 points to your overall point total if you will complete this by 11:59pm on the Tuesday (5/9) of Finals Week. </p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> After submitting your evaluation, you must provide with me a screenshot of your Course Evaluation Summary page showing that you have completed the task. Please submit your screenshot into this SIMnet assignment. </p>
