# Independent Project 1-5 AirTable Alternative 
Life’s Animal Shelter (LAS) is an animal adoption agency that strives to keep its expenses down and donations up and is mainly run by volunteers. LAS does not turn any animal away, and its goal is to find homes for all animals within six months of their arrival. Julie Freed, one of the volunteers, has begun building a database for LAS. For this project, you work with her database, which currently has one table that contains information about the pets currently at LAS. Add one field into the table, edit field properties, enter data into records, modify the datasheet layout, and sort and filter the data in the table.

## Skills Covered in This Project
- Duplicate a shared database.
- Use the Airtable table editor.
- Add a new field into a table.
- Save a table.
- Edit records.
- Sort data in a table.
- Filter data in a table.

1. Right-click on the shared **LifesAnimalShelter-01** database and select 'Duplicate base' to create your own editable copy. (Leave all the settings as they are in the subsequent dialog.)
1. Right-click on the newly copied database and edit the name on the subsequent dialog by replacing the word 'copy' (at the end) with your first and last name.  Press 'Return' to save this new name.
