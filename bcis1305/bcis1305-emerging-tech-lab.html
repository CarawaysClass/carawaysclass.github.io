<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>At the end of this lab, you will be able to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Identify different types and examples of Emerging Technologies.</li>
<li>Describe how certain Emerging Technologies work and how they are used.</li>
<li>Describe the effect of Emerging Technologies on our personal lives.</li>
<li>Explain how Emerging Technologies are impacting our work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Tasks</h3>

<ol>
<li>If you are in my face-to-face class or if the University Park campus is convenient for you to visit, plan to spend at least an hour in the <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/news/28315.htm" target="_blank">Innovation Room</a> found on the 7th floor of Building 13 familiarizing yourself with the different technologies found there.  </li>
<li>For my online students who may not have the option to visit the University Park campus, provided above.</li>
<li>Do your own research on two or three technologies that you find most interesting.</li>
<li>Download and save a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/CarawaysClass/carawaysclass.github.io/raw/master/bcis1305/EmergingTechLab-template.docx">Emerging Technology Lab template document</a>.</li>
<li>Fill out the Emerging Technology Lab document by adding the specific information about two of the Emerging Technologies that you find most interesting.  Be sure to replace the place-holder text identified by the [square brackets].</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Work</h3>

<ol>
<li>Save your final document as a Word .docx file with a filename that follows the naming convention: EmergingTechLab-AB.docx where the last two letters (AB) are your initials.</li>
<li>Upload the .docx file to the related SIMnet resource assignment by the designated Due Date.</li>
</ol>
