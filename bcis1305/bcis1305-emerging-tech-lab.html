<h2>Emerging Technology Lab</h2>

<h3>Description </h3>

<p>In this lab, you will investigate different Emerging Technologies - either in the Innovation Room or based on your personal research.  You will then complete the Emerging Technology Lab Report based on your findings.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>At the end of this lab, you will be able to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Identify different types and examples of Emerging Technologies.</li>
<li>Describe how certain Emerging Technologies work and how they are used.</li>
<li>Describe the effect of Emerging Technologies on our personal lives.</li>
<li>Explain how Emerging Technologies are impacting our work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Tasks</h3>
