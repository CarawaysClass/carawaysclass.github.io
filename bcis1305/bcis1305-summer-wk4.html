<div style="font-family: sans-serif;"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Databases and Emerging Technology</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Databases make it easy for you to ensure your data are accurate, organized, and usable. This chapter covers the basics of working with a relational database.  An exciting and relatively new, cloud-based Relative Database Management System (RDBMS) is something called Airtable (<a href="https://airtable.com" target="_blank">airtable.com</a>).  Only a few decades ago, a computer was considered to be an island with only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk. Now, through communication networks and the Internet, individual computers have direct electronic access to almost unlimited sources of information.</p>
<p>In today’s world, almost all information is stored in databases. They are an important part of nearly every organization including schools, hospitals, and banks. To effectively compete in today’s world, you need to know how to find information and understand how it is stored.</p>
<p>Technology continues to expand into more areas of our lives each day.  And though we often focus on the personal aspects of its effect, technology is certainly changing the way in which we work.  As a new college student, you may have yet to enter the workforce.  Or, perhaps, you are a student who has returned to college with the goal of developing a new skillset.  Either way, it is important for us to consider how technology is molding, if not completely redefining, what our jobs will look like in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to learning about databases, we will also investigate some of the latest trends in Emerging Technologies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D Scanning</li>
<li>3D Printing</li>
<li>Virtual Reality</li>
<li>Augmented Reality</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Digital Assistants (e.g., <a href="http://amzn.to/2iK86fB" target="_blank">Amazon Echo</a>)</li>
<li>Inexpensive Microcontrollers (e.g., <a href="https://www.arduino.cc" target="_blank">Arduino</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies are finding their way into new areas of our lives and being applied to our work.  These changes are also prompting us to consider the ethical and moral impact of these technologies as they make their way into our personal and professional lives.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>At the end of this week, you will be able to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Describe how data is organized: characters, fields, records, tables, and databases.</li>
<li>Describe databases, including the need for databases and database management systems (DBMSs).</li>
<li>Distinguish among individual, company, distributed, and commercial databases.</li>
<li>Describe strategic database uses and security concerns.</li>
<li>Create your own custom database using a RDBMS like Airtable.</li>
<li>Identify different types and examples of Emerging Technologies.</li>
<li>Describe how certain Emerging Technologies work and how they are used.</li>
<li>Describe the effect of Emerging Technologies on our personal lives.</li>
<li>Explain how Emerging Technologies are impacting our work.</li>

</ul>

If visiting the University Park campus (of Lone Star College) is convenient for you, be sure to stop by the Innovation Room, Bldg 13 Rm 739.  There you will find all kinds of cool and emerging technology that you can try for yourself.  If getting to campus isn't possible, here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NiY3Fu8o2Hft2aL7q6XV_TCLvyY1Oeg8HxNjIx2arJw/edit" target="_blank">Google Slides presentation "tour"</a> of the room and its technologies.
