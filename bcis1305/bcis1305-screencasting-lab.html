<h2>Screencasting Lab</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this lab, we will look at the process of recording and publishing a Screencast on your own computer. By definition, a Screencast is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration (Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast" target="_blank">Screencast</a>). </p>

<p>Knowing how to create and publish a screencast is a valuable skill to have. It comes in handy when you need to help someone understand what you are seeing/experiencing on your device as in a technical support situation. It&#8217;s also helpful when you want to make a digital presentation and you need to record and share that with someone.<br/>
There are a variety of software applications that can be used to record the video and audio from your computer. For this exercise, we will be using the web-based screencasting software, <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic.com</a>. </p>
