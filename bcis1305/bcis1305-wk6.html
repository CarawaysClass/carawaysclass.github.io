<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In our world today, we are surrounded by information graphics. We see them in television programming, web sites, and published material of all kinds. PowerPoint gives you the ability to create information graphics—to visually display information in ways that help an audience quickly grasp the concepts you are presenting. You can choose from many options, such as adding shapes or color for emphasis, pictures to illustrate, diagrams to show processes, and charts to show data relationships.</p>
<p>In our third chapter of PowerPoint, you will learn how to create new theme colors customized for your topic, apply animation, and link to a video from a web site. You also explore PowerPoint’s rehearsal features to help you perfect your delivery timing and techniques, project your presentation more effectively, and prepare a presentation to be self-running.</p> 
<p>Finally, you will work on the second of our Capstone projects.</p>
