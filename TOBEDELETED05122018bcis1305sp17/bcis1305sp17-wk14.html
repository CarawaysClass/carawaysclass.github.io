<h2>Week 14 - Databases</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Databases make it easy for you to ensure your data are accurate, organized, and usable. This chapter covers the basics of working with a relational database.  Two common relational database management systems (RDBMS) are Microsoft Access and a cloud-based RDBMS known as Airtable (<a href="https://airtable.com" target="_blank">airtable.com</a>).  Only a few decades ago, a computer was considered to be an island with only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk. Now, through communication networks and the Internet, individual computers have direct electronic access to almost unlimited sources of information.</p>

<p>In today’s world, almost all information is stored in databases. They are an important part of nearly every organization including schools, hospitals, and banks. To effectively compete in today’s world, you need to know how to find information and understand how it is stored.</p>
